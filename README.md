# ChinaTownshipData
GIS Data showing 4th order administrative division (townships/乡镇)

This data was sourced in ESRI shapefile format from an online vendor in China (https://www.dssz.net/7800724.html). 

It has been converted to GEOJSON format and shared without change. 

The WKT format for each township is also included as a field in the GEOJSON.

Errors in the product may exist and have been flagged (see for example here: https://twitter.com/abeleung/status/1223501958901719042) 

Perhaps I will fix these errors in the future, but for now the data exists as is. 

Note: The borders shown in this data do NOT always conform to international standards for example Arunachal Pradesh shows the entirety of China's claims, but not the official border.

TO DO: Transform this data into point data and a csv with coordinates, using peak analyis methods.
